If we look at the progress of this project so we were able to develop the Admin Panel success fully and sub programs to estimate the weight given depth vectors were also developed. The only part where we still struggled was the ``Core Component". Our dataset collection was impacted due to Covid-19. The best we have now is YOLO object detector which is giving us on average \(80\%\) workable predictions, it gives us the bounding box for abdomen which we use to extract heart girth's information . Since we also have proposed that we can segment out the mask of cattle from Mask RCNN, which we trained on our own, because existing one was not as accurate as we wanted on cattle's side view, and extract depth information corresponding to this mask from image then given this information if we have cattle's weight labeled dataset we can train a regression model on this depth mask to get the accuracy up to \(90-95\%\) because the depth values encapsulate the whole 3D information about the cattle. This is the future work we propose for which Mask RCNN is trained for better masks for this problem. Also we have compiled a very diverse dataset for this problem which we think is going to help a lot if someone tries to solve this problem in future.
